# Pixiv Crawler
Crawl IDs from daily ranking of Pixiv.
Most packages are not stuitable for current Pixiv website, so I have to rewrite a cralwer.

## Run
First please copy you Pixiv cookie to the constant.py
Then you can run the crawler.
run main.py to crawl IDs fom Pixiv.
The date range can be config in main.py

The convert.py can be used to merge IDs files into several big files, which can be usefull when copy the IDs for downloading.
